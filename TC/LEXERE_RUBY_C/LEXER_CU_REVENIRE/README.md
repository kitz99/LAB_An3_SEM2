A small C Lexer written in Ruby for my Compilation Techniques Laboratory. 
Lexer is based on a Deterministic Finite Automata (I used this library: https://github.com/hagabaka/finite-automaton for Finite Automata)
For output I used terminal-table gem: [https://github.com/tj/terminal-table]
Tested by prof. Dragulici.
